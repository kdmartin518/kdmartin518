# About

Recent graduate of an intensive Data Analytics program, focused on developing skills in data preparation, processing, and analysis to obtain the Google Data Analytics certificate. 7 yearsâ€™ experience in customer service including 4 years in medical offices have led to developed skills in detail orientation, critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration. 

Using spreadsheets (ie Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Libreoffice Calc) I track my budgets like everybody else, but I also track my time each week and use the data to compare how well I'm sticking to my schedule and make adjustments accordingly while I plan the next week and make progress toward my goals.

Using R I've written programs to handle data from my personal finances and part-time work as a driver for Door Dash. I can easily generate automatic, visual reports which give quick insights into stats like how well I'm sticking to my budget, or which days pay the most to make deliveries during. It's also a great tool to identify patterns in my spending, or whether a certain time of day has been less lucrative.

Data is my native language; I get excited when I find new perspectives to analyze situations from. I thrive on any opportunity to learn more about how the world and its parts work. Send me a message if you want to talk data, programming, abstract philosophy, video games, or cats.
